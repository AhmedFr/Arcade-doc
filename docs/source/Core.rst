Core
****

General
=====
The core is the system that allows you to launch the arcade program and connect the different libraries in real time.

Keys management
=====
When the events go through the Core in order to be transmitted from the graphics library to the game library, a translation of the events is done.

All key codes are transformed to match SFML key macros according to the following codes:

Shortcuts
=====
The core can detect some shortcuts.

    * **Exit:** Q
    * **Go to menu:** Escape
    * **Restart game:** R
    * **Next graphical librairy:** L
    * **Previous graphical librairy**: K
    * **Next game:** N
    * **Previous game:** B

**SFML Key codes:**

For example, here are the key codes for the SDL2 and Ncurses libraries which will be translated into SFML when passing through the Core.
