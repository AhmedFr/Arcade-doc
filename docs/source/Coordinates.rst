Description
===========
There are multiple reference to deal with coordinates.
Usualy we use pixels reference, but in this project game part don't communicate with graphical part.
That is why we use percent reference instead.
There are one special case for image rect.

    - **Mouse position** : Percent
- **Components**
    - **X and Y coordinates** : Percent
    - **Width and Height** : Percent
    - **Rect** : Pixels
