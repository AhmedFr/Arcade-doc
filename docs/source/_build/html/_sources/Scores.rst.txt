Description
===========
The highest scores of each game are displayed in the menu.
In each game if a player beats the highest score his score is then saved and set as the new highest score.
If the score is not higher than the best one, it wil not be saved.

How ?
===========
In order to have this system, we need a scoreboard.txt file placed where the arcade is launched.
This file contains the highest score of each game which can then be red or modified.
To add a game score to the file, you need to follow this template:

    GAME_NAME: PLAYER_NAME SCORE
