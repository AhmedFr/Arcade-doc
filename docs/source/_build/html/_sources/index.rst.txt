Welcome to our Arcade documentation!
====================================

**Arcade** is a c++ project made in our second year in Epitech.
The Project consists to creating a fully functionnal arcade with some
special features, the main one is to be able to dynamicaly change the
graphical library used to render the game or to swap games on the go.
We have to this without the game having the knowledge of which graphical
library is being used, or else it would have been to easy.

Thus there is three parts to this project:

- **The games:** they are arcade games (snake, pacman...) that should only conatin the game loop and says what should be displayed and where.
- **The graphical libraries:** they are the ones that with the information renders everything and actualy displays stuff on screen.
- **The core:** it is the part that ties the other two together, it is the manager of the dynamic libraries and the one who sends the information from one part to the other.

To get this ecosystem to work, we implemented abstract interfaces so all parts can easily communicate information
and use them.
